    "Data sequence clustering algorithms groups series based on their shapes. An important feature regarding clustering algorithms is their ability to deal with subtle changes in shapes; in some cases, being able to identify small shape variations in a set is key to correctly produce the most appropriate clusters for our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use [Khiva's](https://khiva-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) implementation of [_kShape_](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~gravano/Papers/2017/tods17.pdf) to classify different types of meat. _kShape_ outperforms other algorithms like _kMeans_, as it obtains better results due to the lack of dependence on scale and shifting. In this use-case, we run both algorithms and compare their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have chosen a [Meat Dataset](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=Meat) containing 60 samples. Each series is obtained by a spectograph and we have different kind of meat: chicken, pork or turkey. These spectrographs are used in chemometrics to classify food types, with real application in food safety and quality assurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this use case is to use Khiva's implementation of _kShape_ and _kMeans_ to cluster the results of the spectrograph.\n",
