# Electric Consumption Rate

## Summary

In this use case, we analyse the energy data from 100 commercial/industrial sites and find out that the 
consumption rates assigned to each site are correct. 

We use a predictive modelling in order to perform this analysis. 

The analysis performed to find out the correct use of electric consumption rates is based on:
- Geographical research.
- Features extraction and predictive modelling.
- Similarity research.  

We are considering that consumption rates are assigned according to the kind of sub-industry sites are established. 

Khiva library is used to re-dimension the data, extract the features and compose the features matrix for the predictive 
modelling and obtain similarities between sites of interest.


> Note: The file time-series-redimension-applied.npy contains modified data in this use-case after applying a 
dimension reduction technique of the time series.
